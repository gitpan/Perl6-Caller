Revision history for Perl6-Caller

0.100   October 18, 2009
        - Move author tests out of the way.

0.04    April 21, 2007
        - Got rid of the alternate package altogether.

0.03    April 21, 2007
        - Had to rename the 'caller' package to '_caller' because
          FindBin::libs has a 'package caller' declaration and thus the author
          now owns that namespace.

0.02    April 21, 2007
        - First public release.
        - I lied.  This is the second public release, but I fixed a few doc
          nits.

0.01    Date/time
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
